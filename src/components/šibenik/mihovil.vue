            It is a medieval fort in Šibenik, Šibenik-Knin County, Croatia, situated on a steep hill above the old historic center of the city<br/>
            Its strategically favorable and dominant position made it the central part of Šibenik fortification system<br/>
            The location was more or less continuously occupied since the Iron Age, as is witnessed by numerous archaeological findings from the era<br/>
            The city of Šibenik was first mentioned on 25 December 1066 in a charter signed by King Peter Krešimir IV and verified by his courtiers. It is widely considered that the signing took place at St. Michael's Fortress<br/>
            St. Michael's Fortress was named after the oldest church in Šibenik, St. Michael's church, which was located inside its walls<br/>
            One theory suggests that the church was built during the first wave of Christianization of Croatia, from the late 8th to the early 9th century.The first source that mentions St. Michael's church is a 12th/13th century hagiographic text Vita beati Ioannis episcopi et confessoris Traguriensis<br/>
            The miraculous image of Madonna of the Castle, highly revered by the citizens of Šibenik, was originally kept inside St. Michael's church<br/>
            The importance of the fortress is evident not only in its favorable geographical position, but also in numerous archaeological findings, ranging from the Iron Age to 20th century<br/>
