           The gate was built 1543 in the port of Fo≈°a, and was then the main entrance to the city<br/>
           Above the gate is a triumphal arch with a passage for vehicles and two smaller passages for pedestrians on each side<br/>
           The land gate is decorated with various scenes: the city coat of arms depicting St. Carved on horseback, the coat of arms of the Venetian Republic of Veneto depicting the lion of St. Marko and some others<br/>
           Today, they bear witness to the Renaissance influence of that historical period, and are considered one of the most beautiful monuments from the era of Venetian rule in Dalmatia<br/>
