            The Church is a church located in Zadar, Croatia. Its name refers to Donatus of Zadar, who began construction on this church in the 9th century and ended it on the northeastern part of the Roman forum<br/>
            Originally named Church of the Holy Trinity,[3] in the 15th century it was re-dedicated to St Donatus and is the largest Pre-Romanesque building in Croatia<br/>
            The Zadar Bishop Donatus led the representations of the Dalmatian cities to Constantinople and Charles the Great, which is why this church bears slight resemblance to Charlemagne's court chapels<br/>
            The Church belongs to the Pre-Romanesque architectural period<br/>
            The circular church, formerly domed, is 27 m high and is characterised by simplicity and technical primitivism. It has three radially situated apses and an ambulatory around the central area, surmounted by circular gallery<br/>
            It was built on the Roman forum, and materials from buildings in the latter were used in its construction<br/>
            Among the fragments which are built into the foundations it is still possible to distinguish the remains of a sacrificial altar on which is written IVNONI AVGUSTE IIOVI AVGUSTO<br/>
            The use of the church has varied during its lifetime; during the rule of the Republic of Venice it was a warehouse, as well as during the French occupation and under the Austrians<br/>
            After the city was annexed to Yugoslavia, it served as an archaeological museum for a short period of time<br/>
            The building is currently used as the concert venue for the annual International Festival of Medieval Renaissance Music because of its acoustics
