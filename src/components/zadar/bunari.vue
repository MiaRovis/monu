            The three wells square is a square in zadar created in the Middle Ages when the Venetians built a castle with a defensive moat on the northern tip of the Zadar peninsula<br/>
            At that time, a large number of houses were demolished in order to create a cleared space in front of the castle<br/>
            with three well crowns was built on the site of the defense canal, which gave the entire area its name<br/>
            Not long after, a smaller round church of Our Lady of the Castle was built, which was later extended<br/>
            The well crowns themselves are much younger, they date from 1751 and have a baroque shape<br/>
            The area once served as a defensive ditch around Ka≈°tela<br/>
