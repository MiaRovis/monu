            The Roman Forum is a rectangular forum surrounded by the ruins of several important ancient government buildings at the center of the city of Rome<br/>
            Citizens of the ancient city referred to this space, originally a marketplace, as the Forum Magnum, or simply the Forum<br/>
            For centuries the Forum was the center of day-to-day life in Rome: the site of triumphal processions and elections; the venue for public speeches, criminal trials, gladiatorial matches and the nucleus of commercial affairs<br/>
            Here statues and monuments commemorated the city's great men<br/>
            The heart of ancient Rome, it has been called the most celebrated meeting place in the world, and in all history<br/>
            Located in the small valley between the Palatine and Capitoline Hills, the Forum today is a sprawling ruin of architectural fragments and intermittent archaeological excavations attracting 4.5 million or more sightseers yearly<br/>
            Many of the oldest and most important structures of the ancient city were located on or near the Forum. The Roman Kingdom's earliest shrines and temples were located on the southeastern edge<br/>
            These included the ancient former royal residence, the Regia, and the Temple of Vesta, as well as the surrounding complex of the Vestal Virgins, all of which were rebuilt after the rise of imperial Rome<br/>
            An important function of the Forum, during both Republican and Imperial times, was to serve as the culminating venue for the celebratory military processions known as Triumphs<br/>
           There is a lot more to know about the Forum Romanum, so make sure to explore it!
