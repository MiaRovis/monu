        <p id="ime"><b>The Kamerlengo fortress</b><br/>
            Ka≈°tel Kamerlengo was built in the southwest of the city, to defend the sea channel and the approach to the port<br/>
            The fort has a trapezoidal floor plan with a monumental polygonal tower facing the sea at the place of the Chain Tower and smaller corner towers<br/>
            Around the fortress there was a rampart with a retaining wall, and a wide defensive moat towards the city from the north and east<br/>
            The main gate of the castle with a lunette and drawbridge is on the north side of the castle<br/>
            In the middle of the curtain on the south, west and north sides is a berteska with a hanging arch on consoles<br/>
            In the inner courtyard there were residential buildings for the castellan and crew and the chapel of St. Brand<br/>
            It is located on the southwestern edge of the city of Trogir, in the corner of the walls<br/>
            The oldest part is the polygonal tower from the end of the 14th century<br/>
