           The reserve, also know as a swamp, is located east of Trogir and west of Divulje<br/>
           It was declared in 2000 based on an expert study that covered the ornithological and ichthyological peculiarities of the area<br/>
           The entire wetland area is a favorite nesting ground, a small reserve of fauna from eels to migratory birds, storks, herons, ducks and others, as well as seagulls, gulls, and grebes<br/>
           Pantan is a swamp located right next to the sea coast, it is the rest of the former swamp, which had a much larger area, but was reduced throughout history by filling and urbanization<br/>
           The swampy area originates from the river Rika, which rises from 12 small sources, forms a lake, and flows into the sea after 1 km<br/>
           It s a typical Mediterranean marsh with brackish water, a short river and a gravel dune that closes the lagoon<br/>
           Pantan still has its value today as a typical example of a swamp of the eastern Adriatic coast, where fresh water and sea mix, which creates specific biocenoses<br/>
