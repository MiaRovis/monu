        <p id="ime"><b>Čiovo island</b><br/>
           It is an island located off the Adriatic coast in Croatia with an area of 28.8 square kilometres (11.1 sq mi) (length 15.3 km (9.5 mi), width up to 3.5 km, population of 5,908 inhabitants and its highest peak is 218 m (Rudine)<br/>  
           Čiovo is located in central Dalmatia, protecting the town of Trogir and Kaštela gulf<br/>
           Čiovo is connected to Trogir by a bridge, but the town spreads itself onto Čiovo, so it is a part of Trogir<br/>
           Since 1964 the island was connected by a bridge to Trogir which is itself connected to the mainland by another bridge but the development of tourism though generated so much traffic that this connection suffered severe capacity shortages in high season<br/>
           A construction of a new bridge which connects Čiovo directly with the mainland began in February 2015 and was opened to traffic on July 17, 2018. It is 546,34 m long and is located 1km east of the old one<br/>
           The remains of forts and walls, as well as the artefacts dating back to the Antiquity, indicate that the Island of Čiovo, on the western side of which there is the present-day Municipality of Okrug, was already inhabited in the prehistoric times<br/>
           Čiovo had many villages and it was a place for lepers. Remains of the pre-Romanesque church of St. Peter have been found near Slatine, in the Supetar cove<br/>
           The medieval church of St. Maurice has been preserved in Žedno and the pre-Romanesque church of Our Lady at the Sea<br/>
           A small chapel named Lady of Prizidnice located on the south side of the island can still be visited today<br/>
