            The palace, located in the historical center of Trogir, is a complex consisting of Romanesque buildings, most likely built around 1457<br/>
            The palace was rebuilt several more times, and today it has the appearance of a two-story building with a high attic, built of properly hewn stone blocks decorated with stone plastic by excellent craftsmen<br/>
            After 1474 a Renaissance courtyard with galleries was built by Nikola Florentinec, and a late Renaissance reconstruction around 1600<br/>
            The main entrance facade on the east has a Renaissance portal by Ivan DuknoviÄ‡<br/>
            The portal on the southern facade is the work of Nikola Florentinac<br/>
            Under the code Z-4379, it is registered under the type "immovable cultural property - individual", the legal status of protected cultural property, classified as "public buildings"
