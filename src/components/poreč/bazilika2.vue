        <p id="ime"><b>Inside of the Euphrasian Basilica</b><br/>
            The present basilica, dedicated to Mary, was built in the sixth century during the period of Bishop Euphrasius<br/>
            The wall mosaics were executed by Byzantian masters and the floor mosaics by local experts<br/>
            Euphrasius, holding the church in his arms, is represented on one of the mosaics on the apse, next to St. Maurus<br/>           
            The basilica is part of a complex composed of:<br/>
            - A 6th-century octagonal baptistry<br/>
            - A 16th-century bell tower<br/>
            - A colonnaded atrium. Built after the basilica, it is covered on all four sides by a portico which houses a rich collection of stone monuments<br/>
            - An Episcopal residence, built in the 6th century <br/>
            - A trefoil-shaped memorial chapel, built in the 17th and 19th centuries<br/>
            The two aisles are separated from the nave by 18 elegant Greek marble colonnades with richly sculpted Byzantine and Romanesque capitals, decorated with depictions of animals<br/>
            They all carry the monogram of Saint Euphrasius. The arches between the capitals are decorated with stucco work<br/>
            The atrium is a typical example of Byzantine architecture, as are the columns, the tiles on the altar rail and all the abundant mosaics<br/>
            Most impressive is the representation of Christ with the apostles, and beneath it a frieze of 13 medallions with a picture of Christ as the Lamb in the centre, surrounded by 12 medallions depicting various martyrs<br/>
