            The episcopal complex, which comprises the basilica itself, a sacristy, a baptistery and the bell tower of the nearby archbishop's palace, is an excellent example of early Byzantine architecture in the Mediterranean region<br/>
            The Euphrasian basilica has for the most part retained its original shape, but accidents, fires and earthquakes have altered a few details<br/>
            The floor mosaic from its oratory, originally part of a large Roman house, is still preserved in the church garden<br/>
            The church houses also holy objects and other artworks from the Palaeo-Christian, Byzantine and Middle Ages periods<br/>
            The most striking feature of the basilica are its mosaics, mostly with gold grounds, dating from the 6th century<br/>
            Because of its exceptional value, it has been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List since 1997
