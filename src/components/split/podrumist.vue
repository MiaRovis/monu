            The cellars, sometimes referred to as the "basement halls", is a set of substructures, located at the southern end of Diocletian's Palace<br/>
            They represent one of the best preserved ancient complexes of their kind in the world, Diocletians palace<br/>
            During the later Roman empire, the function of the cellars was partly to elevate the Emperor's chambers on the floor above, but they were also the storage area for foodstuffs and wine for the Palace<br/>
            In the Early Middle Ages, as refugees made their homes behind the safety of the palace walls, a part of the underground complex was used as a residential area<br/>
            The old monastery and church of St. Klare, was located above the eastern section of the cellars. It is suggested that the eastern section of the cellars partially collapsed during this time, and resulting in the destruction of the monastery<br/>
            The cellars entrance starts/terminates at the Cardo maximus within the palace, approaching from the peristyle and the Porta Aenea<br/>
            The massive barrel-vaulted cellars are shaped in the construction of the Palace in a downward-facing position to level the southern, residential part of the Palace with other parts of the Palace<br/>
            The walls served them as the basis of Imperial dwelling buildings above them, and their forms of space probably coincided with the shape of those buildings that disappeared by molding houses and streets of Split in the Middle Ages
