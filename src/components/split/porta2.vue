          The Silver Gate or "the Eastern Gate", are one of the four principal Roman gates into the old town of Split<br/>
          The gate faces east towards the Roman town of Epetia, today Stobreč<br/>
          During late antiquity, the gate was known as the Porta Orientalis - Eastern Gate<br/>
          Probably in or around the 6th century, a small church dedicated to St. Apolinar was built above the gate, in the sentry corridor<br/>
          This coincided with the complex seeing an influx of refugees from outlying communities<br/>
          The gate was still in operation during the Middle Ages<br/>
          At the end of the 19th century, the church was enlarged, and its present appearance was gained in the early 1930s<br/>
          The gate was extensively renovated in 1952, after the Allied bombing of Yugoslavia in World War II during which the Baroque church Dušica suffered extensive damage<br/>
          The Silver Gate was used by the Pope John Paul II in his popemobile on the way to the Cathedral of Saint Domnius, during his visit to Split in 2000<br/>
