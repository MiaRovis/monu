            The church was built from 1723 till 1732, when it was blessed by Marko DragojeviÄ‡<br/>
            It was built by Franciscan monks who moved to Vukovar from the village of Srijemske Laze<br/>
            It is a part of the monastery in Vukovar<br/>
            It's 58 meters long, making in the thirds longest church in Croatia<br/>
            After severe suffering in the Serbian aggression and occupation, it was thoroughly restored, although some wounds were left as a reminder of wartime suffering<br/>
